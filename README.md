<h3 align="center">AI Engineer | ML Engineer | AI Grad Student</h3>

I, an enthusiastic AI graduate and a seasoned QA professional, am on a thrilling journey of rediscovering my fervor for coding, development, and artificial intelligence. Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Guelph, diligently advancing through the second year of my Master of Science in Computer Science + Artificial Intelligence program.

I am all about harnessing the formidable power of AI algorithms to unravel solutions and glean insights into a myriad of contemporary issues, big or small. Drawing from my nearly decade-long career as a quality assurance consultant, I am keen to amalgamate my wealth of experience with my extensive knowledge in machine learning and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of delivering pragmatic and innovative business solutions to tackle real-world challenges.

## Thesis
[AI SOLUTION FOR NON-INVASIVE MONITORING OF ESSENTIAL BIO-SIGNAL MARKER (BREATHING RATE)](https://github.com/SayanaVrgs/AI_SOLUTION__BIO-SIGNAL_MARKER)

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our healthcare system. Many countries around the world, including Canada, are grappling with a severe shortage of healthcare professionals. The current strain caused by the pandemic on our healthcare system has led to serious burnout and immense stress among healthcare workers. As AI technology is making rapid strides in every field, the need of the hour is to explore AIâ€™s effective and positive implementation in
alleviating at least some of this heavy load from our healthcare system. One aspect would be implementing a solution capable of remotely monitoring the vital signs of patients requiring continuous care. Such a solution must be inclusive, transcending gender, ethnicity, and skin color barriers. This thesis focuses on developing a non-invasive AI solution designed to monitor an individualâ€™s respiratory rate from a distance via a thermal camera. This thesis document delves into the motivation behind this thesis project, the methodologies employed, the segment-wise and overall outcomes, and a discussion regarding the insight gained based on these outcomes.
Keywords: Thermal imaging, computer vision, machine learning, bio-signal markers
